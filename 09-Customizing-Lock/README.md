# Customizing Lock

This example shows how to customize the `Lock` widget. Sometimes you need to change some UI stuff so this is what we are going to do.

You can read a quickstart for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ionic/09-customizing-lock). 

## Getting Started

To run this quickstart you can fork and clone this repo.

Be sure to set the correct values for your Auth0 application in the `www/app/auth0.variables.js` file.

To run the application

```bash
# Install the dependencies
bower install

# Get the plugins
ionic state restore --plugins

# Run
ionic serve
```
