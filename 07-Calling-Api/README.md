# Calling API

This example shows how to make authenticated API calls using the JSON Web Token given by Auth0 in your Ionic application.
You can read a quickstart for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ionic/06-authorization). 

## Getting Started

To run this quickstart you can fork and clone this repo.

Be sure to set the correct values for your Auth0 application in the `www/app/auth0.variables.js` file.

To run the application

```bash
# Install the dependencies
bower install

# Get the plugins
ionic state restore --plugins

# Run
ionic serve
```
